# WildID User Guide

Welcome to WildID! This guide will walk you through the features of the application and how to use them to identify wildlife, plants, and fungi.

## 1. Home Screen

The home screen is the main entry point of the application. Here you will find:

*   **Identify Button**: Tap this button to start the identification process.
*   **Recent Identifications**: A list of your most recent identifications for quick access.
*   **Species Categories**: An overview of the number of species available in the database for each category (birds, plants, fungi).

## 2. Identifying a Species

There are two ways to identify a species:

### 2.1. Using the Camera

1.  From the home screen, tap the **"Take Photo"** button.
2.  This will open the camera view.
3.  Point your camera at the subject you want to identify and tap the **"Capture"** button.
4.  The app will then analyze the image and display the identification results.

### 2.2. Uploading an Image

1.  From the home screen, tap the **"Upload Image"** button.
2.  You can either drag and drop an image file or click **"Choose File"** to select an image from your device.
3.  The app will analyze the image and display the identification results.

## 3. Identification Results

After the AI model has analyzed the image, the results screen will display the following information:

*   **Top Result**: The most likely species match, along with its common name and the model's confidence level.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the species.
*   **Edibility**: Information about whether the species is edible, poisonous, or not applicable.
*   **Herbal Benefits**: Any known herbal benefits of the species.
*   **Warning**: If a species is poisonous, a prominent warning message will be displayed.

From the results screen, you can:

*   **Identify Another**: Return to the home screen to start a new identification.
*   **Save**: Save the identification to your history (this is a mock feature in the current version).

## 4. Identification History

The history screen (not yet fully implemented) will allow you to view all your past identifications.

We hope you enjoy using WildID!
