# App Architecture Design

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the wildlife and plant identification application. The architecture is designed to be scalable, robust, and capable of supporting the app's core features.

## System Components

The application will consist of the following main components:

1.  **Mobile Client**: A cross-platform mobile application (iOS and Android) that will serve as the primary user interface.
2.  **Backend Server**: A server-side application that will handle user authentication, data storage, and communication with the AI model.
3.  **AI Model Serving**: A dedicated service for hosting and serving the trained AI models for species identification.
4.  **Database**: A database to store user data, identification history, and the knowledge base for edibility and herbal benefits.

## Architecture Diagram

A high-level diagram of the app architecture will be created to visualize the interaction between the components.

## Technology Stack

The following technology stack is recommended for the development of the application:

*   **Mobile Client**: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.
*   **Backend Server**: Python with a web framework like Flask or Django.
*   **AI Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving or a similar model deployment framework.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL for the relational database, and a NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing unstructured data if needed.

## User Interface (UI) Mockups

UI mockups will be designed to illustrate the app's user flow and layout. The mockups will cover the following screens:

*   **Home Screen**: Featuring a prominent "Identify" button and a feed of recent identifications.
*   **Camera Screen**: For capturing images of wildlife and plants.
*   **Identification Results Screen**: Displaying the identified species, confidence score, and additional information (edibility, herbal benefits).
*   **History Screen**: A list of the user's past identifications.
*   **Species Details Screen**: A detailed view of a specific species with images, description, and other relevant information.
