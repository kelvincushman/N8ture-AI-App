# Navigation & Camera Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**APK Built:** composeApp-debug.apk (35MB) at 21:44 UTC

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Camera Capture Button Not Working
**Problem:** The capture button was present but clicking it didn't trigger identification or navigate anywhere.

**Root Cause:** The navigation logic tried to navigate immediately when `onCapture` was called, but `currentIdentification` was null because the API call hadn't completed yet.

**Solution:**
- Used `LaunchedEffect` to observe `currentIdentification` state
- Navigation now happens automatically when the identification completes
- Added loading state to show progress during API call

### 2. No Visual Feedback During Identification
**Problem:** After clicking capture, nothing happened visually to indicate the app was working.

**Solution:**
- Added `isLoading` state to CameraScreen
- Shows loading overlay with CircularProgressIndicator and "Identifying species..." message
- Disables all camera controls during loading (capture button, gallery, flash, back button)

### 3. Navigation Flow Broken
**Problem:** User got stuck on camera screen with no way forward.

**Solution:**
- Fixed navigation flow: Home → Camera → (capture + API call) → Results → Detail
- Back button always works to return to previous screen
- Results screen shows when identification completes

## 📱 Changes Made

### AppNavigation.kt
```kotlin
// Before: Tried to navigate immediately (failed)
onCapture = { imageData, category ->
    viewModel.identifySpecies(imageData, category)
    currentIdentification?.let { result ->  // ❌ Always null here!
        navController.navigate(ResultsScreenRoute(result.id))
    }
}

// After: Navigation happens when state updates
onCapture = { imageData, category ->
    viewModel.identifySpecies(imageData, category)  // Triggers API call
}

LaunchedEffect(currentIdentification) {
    currentIdentification?.let { result ->
        navController.navigate(ResultsScreenRoute(result.id)) {
            popUpTo(HomeScreenRoute()) { inclusive = false }
        }
    }
}
```

### CameraScreen.kt
- Added `isLoading: Boolean` parameter
- Shows loading overlay when `isLoading = true`
- Hides camera controls during loading
- Disables back button during identification

## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### Gemini API Integration
- **Endpoint:** Google Gemini Vision API
- **API Key:** Configured in `local.properties` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Service:** `GeminiApiService.kt` handles all API calls
- **Request:** Sends Base64-encoded image + category filter
- **Response:** Parsed into `IdentificationResult` with species data

### Trial Management
- **Manager:** `TrialManager.kt` using multiplatform Settings
- **Storage:** Local device storage (persists across app restarts)
- **Limit:** 3 free identifications for non-subscribers
- **Check:** `CheckTrialStatusUseCase` validates before API call
- **Reset:** Reinstalling app resets trial count (local storage cleared)

### Room Database
- **Version:** 2
- **Tables:** `species` (20 columns), `identification_history` (14 columns)
- **DAOs:** `SpeciesDao`, `IdentificationHistoryDao`
- **Offline:** Last 50 species cached for offline viewing

### Koin Dependency Injection
All components registered in `AppInitializer.kt`:
- `MainViewModel` → Manages app state
- `IdentificationRepository` → Coordinates data sources
- `GeminiApiService` → API calls
- `TrialManager` → Trial tracking
- DAOs for database access
