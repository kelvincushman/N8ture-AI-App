# ✅ Rebranding Complete: WildID → N8ture AI App

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Status:** All core branding updated

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updated ✅
All markdown files updated with new branding:

- ✅ `/CLAUDE.md` - Main repository guide
- ✅ `/Walker App/KAppMakerExtended-main/README.md` - Project README
- ✅ `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Implementation tracker
- ✅ `/docs/BUILD_SUMMARY.md` - Build overview
- ✅ `/docs/QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md` - Setup guide
- ✅ `/docs/BRANDING.md` - New branding guidelines

### 2. Code Updated ✅

**Preference Keys (TrialManager.kt):**
```kotlin
// Old:
private const val KEY_TRIAL_COUNT = "wildid_trial_count"
private const val KEY_FIRST_USE_TIMESTAMP = "wildid_first_use_timestamp"
private const val KEY_MAX_TRIAL_COUNT = "wildid_max_trial_count"

// New:
private const val KEY_TRIAL_COUNT = "n8ture_trial_count"
private const val KEY_FIRST_USE_TIMESTAMP = "n8ture_first_use_timestamp"
private const val KEY_MAX_TRIAL_COUNT = "n8ture_max_trial_count"
```

**KDoc Comments:**
```kotlin
/**
 * Manages freemium trial state for N8ture AI App
 * Tracks remaining free identifications (max 3)
 */
```

### 3. Configuration Updated ✅

**local.properties.template:**
- Section header: `## N8ture AI App Configuration`

**RevenueCat Product IDs (in documentation):**
- Monthly: `n8ture_premium_monthly`
- Annual: `n8ture_premium_annual`

## What Stays the Same

### Package Names (Intentional)
**NOT changed** to avoid breaking changes:
- Android: `com.measify.kappmaker`
- iOS: `com.measify.kappmaker`

**Rationale:** Keeping the KAppMaker package structure allows:
- Easier updates from base framework
- No user data migration needed
- Seamless transition from development to production
- Can be rebranded in v2.0 if desired

### Firebase/RevenueCat Configuration
When you set up these services, use the new branding:
- Firebase Project: "N8ture AI" or "N8ture AI App"
- RevenueCat Project: "N8ture AI App"
- Product IDs: Use `n8ture_premium_*`

## Branding Guidelines

### App Identity
- **Name:** N8ture AI App
- **Pronunciation:** "Nature AI App"
- **Tagline:** "Discover Nature Intelligently"

### Visual Identity
- **Primary Color:** `#4CAF50` (Material Green - nature)
- **Secondary Color:** `#2196F3` (Material Blue - tech)
- **Accent Color:** `#9C27B0` (Material Purple - AI)

### App Store Presence
- **Title:** N8ture AI App
- **Subtitle:** Wildlife & Plant Identification
- **Short Desc:** "AI-powered species identification with safety info, edibility, and herbal uses"

### Social Media (Recommended)
- Handles: @N8tureAI, @n8ture.ai
- Hashtags: #N8tureAI #AIIdentification #NatureAI
- Website: n8ture.ai or n8tureai.app

## Files Created

New documentation:
```
/docs/
├── BRANDING.md           ← Comprehensive branding guide
└── [updated all other docs with new name]

/REBRANDING_COMPLETE.md   ← This file
```

## Next Steps for Full Rebranding

### Immediate (Done)
- ✅ Update all documentation
- ✅ Update code comments and preference keys
- ✅ Update configuration templates

### Before Launch
- [ ] Design app icon with "N8ture" or "N8" branding
- [ ] Create app store screenshots with new branding
- [ ] Update splash screen
- [ ] Create marketing materials
- [ ] Register social media handles
- [ ] Secure domain name (n8ture.ai or n8tureai.app)

### Optional (Future)
- [ ] Rebrand package name to `com.n8ture.ai` in v2.0
- [ ] Trademark registration for "N8ture AI"
- [ ] Custom domain for app website

## User-Facing Text Updates Needed

When implementing screens, use these app-facing strings:

**Onboarding:**
```
"Welcome to N8ture AI App"
"Discover Nature Intelligently"
"Identify Any Species Instantly"
```

**Trial Messages:**
```
"3 Free Identifications Remaining"
"Upgrade to N8ture AI Premium"
"Unlock Unlimited Nature Discoveries"
```

**About Screen:**
```
"N8ture AI App v1.0"
"© 2025 N8ture AI App. All rights reserved."
"Powered by Google Gemini AI"
```

**Error Messages:**
```
"N8ture AI couldn't identify this species"
"N8ture AI is temporarily unavailable"
```

## Code Search & Replace Reference

If you need to find any remaining old branding:

```bash
# Search for old branding
cd "/home/ubuntu-server/dev/WalkersApp"
grep -r "WildID\|wildid" --include="*.kt" --include="*.md"
grep -r "WalkersApp" --include="*.kt" --include="*.md"

# Already updated:
# - All .md files in root and /docs
# - TrialManager.kt preference keys
# - local.properties.template
# - Documentation product IDs
```

## Testing Checklist

After implementing screens:
- [ ] Verify trial counter shows "N8ture AI" branding
- [ ] Check paywall screen mentions "N8ture AI Premium"
- [ ] Ensure about/settings shows correct app name
- [ ] Test that preference keys persist correctly with new names
- [ ] Verify RevenueCat products use `n8ture_premium_*` IDs

## Migration from WildID (If applicable)

If you previously built with "WildID":
1. Trial counts will reset (different preference keys)
2. Subscription status maintained (RevenueCat handles this)
3. Consider one-time migration script to copy old preferences
4. Or simply treat as fresh install

---

**Summary:** N8ture AI App branding is fully integrated. All documentation, code comments, preference keys, and configuration templates updated. Package name intentionally kept as `com.measify.kappmaker` for compatibility. Ready for Firebase/RevenueCat setup with new branding!
