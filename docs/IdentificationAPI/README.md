## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Emergency Fix
- [ ] Switch to Gemini 2.5 Flash (1 hour)
- [ ] Test with real users
- [ ] **Result:** 99% cost reduction

### Week 2-4: Enhanced Accuracy
- [ ] Integrate PlantNet for plants (4 hours)
- [ ] Integrate insect.id for insects (4 hours)
- [ ] **Result:** Improved accuracy + cost control

### Month 2+: Long-term Solution
- [ ] Train custom model on RTX 5060 (1-3 days)
- [ ] Deploy hybrid system (8 hours)
- [ ] **Result:** $5-10/month for unlimited identifications
